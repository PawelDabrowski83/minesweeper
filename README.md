# minesweeper

simple Minesweeper in Javascript (alpha stage)

# Why I like this project

It is a fine opportunity to work with JavaScript, to understand DOM crawling and events.<br/>
All interesting JS is found here: 
[minesweeper.js](https://github.com/PawelDabrowski83/minesweeper/blob/master/src/main/webapp/static/html/js/minesweeper.js)


# What is to be done?

First of all it has no tests. Also Java part works only as a framework for JS and it is not working well.
