# minesweeper

simple Minesweeper in Javascript (alpha stage)

# Why I like this project

It is a fine opportunity to work with JavaScript, to understand DOM crawling and events.

# What is to be done?

First of all it has no tests. Also Java part works only as a framework for JS and it is not working well.
